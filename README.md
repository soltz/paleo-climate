This repo contains a python jupyter-notebook to plot EPICA ice-core data and compare to current climate data obtained from the NOAA.  The goal is to study current surface temperature and CO2 variation along with time-derivatives in the context of ice-core data extending backwards 800,000 years. 

Run the notebook p_clim.ipynb or view p_clim.pdf for more information.
